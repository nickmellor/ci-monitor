CI Monitor
==========

Monitors the latest CI builds and reflects the results on a traffic light
and Geckoboard.


Environment
===========

- Runs on a Raspberry Pi Linux box as a Python 3 script
- ci_monitor.py auto-run from /etc/rc.local at bootup
- Will also run on Windows or Linux PC (Mac not tried), though the cleware traffic light software may not.

External libraries used
-----------------------

- requests
- cleware traffic light control program (included in this repo)
- PyYAML


IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
--------------------

This is a port to Python 3 of lights.rb, the original traffic light program written by James Barker. The
 original program only controlled the traffic light. Extensions to the original include logging, on-the-fly
 YAML configuration and Geckoboard push updates
