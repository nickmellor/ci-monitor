CI Monitor
==========

Author as at 19/06/2015: Nick Mellor

Monitors the latest CI builds and reflects the results on a traffic light
and Geckoboard.


Environment
===========

- Currently runs on a Raspberry Pi Linux box as a Python 3 script
- ci_monitor.py auto-run from /etc/rc.local at bootup
- Will also run on Windows or Linux PC (Mac not tried), though the cleware traffic light software may not.

External libraries used
-----------------------

- Python "requests" library
- cleware traffic light control program (included in this repo)


IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
--------------------

This is a port to Python 3 of lights.rb, the original traffic light program written by James Barker.

Changes (May-June 2015):
- ported to Python 3
- added multi-environment monitoring
- added geckoboard push updates
- added TEST tags (thanks to Manish Nigade)
- clarified code
- separated concerns
- Christmas tree lights: draw attention to change of state on traffic light
- red-yellow light shows mix of comms errors and test failures
- red-yellow-green light means some kind of big problem, e.g. proxy down or an unhandled exception
- prepares for operating multiple traffic lights and geckoboard widgets

Would like to see:

- various data put in config file so that only config changes are usually necessary
