CI Monitor
==========

Monitors the latest CI builds and reflects the results on a traffic light
and Geckoboard.


On Raspberry Pi
===============

- Runs on a Raspberry Pi Linux box as a Python 3 script
- ci_monitor.py auto-run from /etc/rc.local at bootup

On Windows
==========

This is useful for testers and developers tasked with tracking the status of the build. The monitor can run
on any number of machines independently

Suggest setting up as a py2exe project:

python setup.py py2exe

then set up a shortcut to run ci_monitor.exe in the dist directory (working directory set to ci-monitor so it can find
config files.)

External libraries used
-----------------------

- requests
- cleware traffic light control program (included in this repo)
- PyYAML


IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
--------------------

This is a port to Python 3 of lights.rb, the original traffic light program written by James Barker. The
 original program only controlled the traffic light. Extensions to the original include logging, on-the-fly
 YAML configuration and Geckoboard push updates
